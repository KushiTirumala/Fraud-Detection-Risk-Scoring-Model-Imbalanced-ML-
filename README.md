# Fraud Detection & Risk Scoring Model

##  Overview
An ML-based fraud detection system identifying high-risk transactions in highly imbalanced datasets.

##  Business Problem
Fraudulent transactions cause financial losses and operational risk.

##  Tech Stack
- Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas)
- SMOTE for imbalance handling
- Classification Algorithms
- Precision-Recall & ROC Analysis

##  Approach
- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE
- Optimized feature selection
- Evaluated models using precision and recall metrics

##  Results
- Improved fraud detection precision
- Reduced false positives through threshold tuning

##  Impact
Enhanced transaction risk monitoring and fraud prevention capability.
